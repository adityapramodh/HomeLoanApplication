Scenario0:
    Data Validation:
    Manually verify the extracted data against the original lease documents.
    Cross-check attribute values (e.g., rent, dates, tenant names) for accuracy.

Scenario1:
    Non-English Text:
    Upload lease documents containing non-English text (e.g., leases in other languages).
    Validate that the model handles multilingual content effectively.

Scenario 2:
    Handling Scanned Documents:
    Convert printed or handwritten lease documents into scanned images (PDFs, images).
    Assess how well the model performs on scanned documents.

Scenario 3:
    Data Consistency Across Deals:
    Upload the same lease document to multiple deals and compare the extracted data.
    Verify that the model produce

Scenario 4:
    Performance on Long Documents:
    Upload lengthy lease agreements (e.g., 50+ pages) to evaluate performance.
    Monitor processing time and resource usage.

Scenario 5:
    Handling Non-Standard Lease Formats:
    Test with lease documents that deviate from the standard format (e.g., unconventional section headings, unique layouts).
    Ensure the model adapts to variations.

Scenario 6:
    Handling Missing Attributes:
    Upload lease documents with missing or incomplete attributes (e.g., tenant name, lease start date).
    Verify that the model gracefully handles missing information without causing errors.

Scenario 7:
    Performance Under Load:
    Simulate high load scenarios by uploading multiple documents simultaneously.
    Monitor system performance (response time, memory usage) during peak usage.
